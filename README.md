# Sample-Application-fitnesstracking
I have created application fitness tracking by using Python with Flask for the backend and HTML with CSS for the front-end. We'll focus on the user's ability to add and view workout entries. Keep in mind that a real-world fitness tracker would require additional features like user authentication, data storage, and more sophisticated data tracking.
